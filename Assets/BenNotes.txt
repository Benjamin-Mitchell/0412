CURRENT CODING PROBLEMS:

- Pathfind:
	- currently doesn't take into account agent's size - assumes one node.
	- test obstacle system
	- need to dynamically update grid with dynamic object positions.
	- deal with not being able to find the path
	- looks odd when it tries to go in a straight line but has to go via node centres...
		- implement a first effort ray-cast? Could be very efficient...
