NEXT STEPS:

	- Make sure each base fits reasonably into the scale of the pathfinder 
		(first levels of bases should be roughly 1 unit)

	- Some smoothing of the pathfinding would be nice. 
		- Doesn't need to go to the centre if we know nothing is in it.
	
	- Expand the "Build new" hammer's window to include prices 
		- this should look something like a shop eventually.

	- make sure resources exist before changing agent state to chase/load them etc.

 
- Pathfind:
	- Fix it taking a very non-direct route
	- currently doesn't take into account agent's size - assumes one node.
	- test obstacle system
	- need to dynamically update grid with dynamic object positions.
	- currently each agent has its own pathfinder to get around thread-sharing issues. Is that bad for mem?
